=abstract start

Setting the <hl>-x</hl> tells Bash to print out the statements as they are being executed.
It can be very useful as a logging facility and for debugging when you need to know which statements were execute and
in what order.

=abstract end


It can be enabled on the command line or on the sh-bang line by providing <hl>-x</hl> or by the <hl>set -x</hl> statement.

It can be disabled using the <hl>set +x</hl> statement.

See this example:

<include file="examples/shell/set-x.sh">

and the output it generates:

<code>
$ ./examples/shell/set-x.sh

+ name=Foo
+ echo Foo
Foo
+ set +x
42
+ language=Bash
+ echo Bash
Bash
</code>
